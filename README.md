# shindakun's shortcodes

## Background

I've been doing more with with Hugo lately both for my own hobby dev site, [shindakun.dev](https://shindakun.dev) and my test [micro.blog](https://shindakun.micro.blog) site. As part of that I wanted to come up with a collection of shortcodes that I could use on the site. I didn't want that to be buried away under a theme so I decided to make a repo for them.

## Shortcodes

- `bookcover` : Display the cover of a book based on it's ISBN number. Queries GoodReads and Google Books API.
